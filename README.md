# BeaverCoffeeDemo
A desktop application written in C#, using WPF and MongoDB. The purpose of the application is to provide a graphical user interface for testing whether the document data model used for data storage would effectively support some key functionalities related to the operations of an international coffee shop business. Implemented demo functionalities include the registration of orders in specific coffee shops, basic localization (product names and currency represented in two languages, English and Swedish, depending on the current location), managing information about customers and employees, inventory management and the generation of reports based on stored data (reports on product sales during a time period, orders served by individual employees).

The user can specify some basic settings for testing the system on the start-up screen: the current country location, the position of the employee using the system and, in case an order will be registered, the name of the coffee shop. Different employee positions are associated with different access rights such that a shop employee may only register orders and customer data. In order to access the complete set of functionalities in the application, choose ‘Corporate sales manager’ as the employee position.

The application requires a MongoDB instance running on start-up, with default settings (localhost, port: 27017).
